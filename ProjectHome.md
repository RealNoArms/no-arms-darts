pygame darts engine - learning python on the fly

This whole mess is happening because I created a couple dart games, Spigot and Quicket, and I wished that I could play them on my cheap electronic dartboard.

Initial check-in is the No Arms Many Mediums Intro animation.  I wrote this to learn Python and Pygame.  Needs refactored badly, but might not do that, might just use lessons learned for the rest of the code.

This was pretty fun to do... it pays homage to the old C64 classic Jumpman.  Again, not the best coding style or approach, but it helped me learn pygame.

I borrowed sprites and sound samples from the Jumpman - Under Construction project by Chris Leathley: http://members.iinet.net.au/~cleathley/jumpman/

Hope to have plug n play functionality to easily add new dart games and select optional interfaces.  Hardware will probably include an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi -- a couple more things to learn on the fly.

First interface planned is usb input from hacked electronic dartboard

Others could include web front end, classic exe app, nbt...
